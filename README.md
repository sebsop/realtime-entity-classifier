## ✨ Key Features

- **Four-Class Detection**: Accurately identifies `owner`, `pet`, `other person`, and `background` classes
- **Adaptive Processing**: Automatically switches between classification and segmentation for improved accuracy
- **Real-Time Performance**: ~33 FPS on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3050)
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally on your device
- **Interactive Controls**: Toggle segmentation mode and visualize confidence scores
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments

## 🧠 Technical Overview

This project combines transfer learning with efficient model deployment to create a responsive computer vision system that runs smoothly on mid-range hardware:

- **Base Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (finetuned from ImageNet weights)
- **Enhancement**: LRASPP MobileNetV3 segmentation model for challenging cases
- **Confidence Threshold**: Auto-switching between models at 0.7 confidence level
- **Training Method**: Transfer learning with frozen feature extraction layers

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sebsop/Realtime-Entity-Classifier.git
cd Realtime-Entity-Classifier

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Classifier

```bash
python src/realtime_classifier.py
```

### Controls

- Press `s` to toggle forced segmentation mode
- Press `q` to quit

## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Classification Model (MobileNetV2)

The system uses a modified MobileNetV2 architecture with:

```python
model.classifier[1] = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(model.classifier[1].in_features, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.2),
    nn.Linear(256, 4)
)
```

- **Intermediate Layer (256 neurons)**: Enhanced representational capacity
- **ReLU Activation**: Efficient non-linearity
- **Dropout (0.2)**: Prevents overfitting
- **Xavier Initialization**: Improves convergence speed

### Training Configuration

- **Optimizer**: Adam with selective training
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-5
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-5
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss with label smoothing (0.1)
- **Epochs**: 10 (converged early)

### Segmentation Enhancement

When classification confidence drops below threshold:

1. An LRASPP MobileNetV3 segmentation model identifies people and pets
2. Segmentation mask isolates the subject from the background
3. Classification is re-run on the masked input
4. System returns to normal mode after confidence improves

### Dataset Overview

- **Total Samples**: 34,575  
- **Class Distribution**:
  - `owner`: 8,750 samples (25.3%)  
    - Sourced from a **2:20 min video** of myself walking around the house in varied lighting conditions, angles and backgrounds.
  - `pet`: 4,575 samples (13.2%)  
    - Extracted from a **30-second video** of my friend Bogdan’s cat, **Felix**.
  - `other person`: 12,500 samples (36.2%)  
    - Includes **2,500 cropped face images** from the [Human Faces Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces?resource=download).
  - `background`: 8,750 samples (25.3%)  
    - Captured from a **30-second video** of walking around the house with no subject in focus.

## 🧪 Known Limitations

1. **Pet Detection**:
   - Accuracy drops when <30% of the pet's body is visible
   - Low lighting reduces confidence by ~40%

2. **Person Identification**:
   - Needs ≥92% confidence to reliably classify "owner" vs "other person"
   - False positives with reflections (mirrors, glass)
   - May struggle with diverse "other person" examples

## 🔧 Customization

### Setting Custom Confidence Threshold

```python
# In realtime_classifier.py
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Default
```

### Toggling Pet Detection

```python
# In realtime_classifier.py
PET_MASK_ENABLED = True  # Set to False to disable generic pet detection
```
